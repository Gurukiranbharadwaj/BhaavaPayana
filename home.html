            <p>Bhaava [ Feelings / Soul / State of Mind ] - Payana [ Travel / Journey / Path ] is a Concert Series
                featuring
                soulful music collected from various parts of the Great Indian Cultural Heritage.
                Showcasing music from folklore / children’s stories / mythological tales & native
                atmosphere, Bhaava-Payana is an experience on its own. A Song narrating a young
                Krishna’s mischievous banter with his mother Yashoda about not stealing butter from the
                pots, to compositions which stir your emotions & question your practical thoughts, the
                performance transcends you to another dimension. Combining genres and styles of music,
                the project aims to create a refreshing sound with an unplugged set emphasising on the use
                of acoustic world instruments. With a strong foundation of Hindustani Classical Music,
                elements of Jazz, Western Classical & Indian Percussion, the concert is a perfect musical
                therapy. Come feel the Music.</p>
